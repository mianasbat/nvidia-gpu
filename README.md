## What is CUDA?     
CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture. CUDA is an API, which allows the programmers
to harness the parallel computation elements with in the GPU. CUDA is written by NVIDIA. It works on 
only NVIDIA GPU. CUDA 1.0 was first release n 2007. CUDA 10 is the most recent version.     
CUDA consists of mainly three parts:    

1. CUDA Toolkit: It includes the libraries, CUDA run time, and developers tools)
1. CUDA Driver: Driver component which is used to run CUDA applications.
1. NVIDIA GPU Device Driver: Kernel mode driver component for NVIDIA GPU's.

## Whast is cuDNN?     
cuDNN is a predefined deep neural network library for CUDA. It helps in deep learning GPU acceleration. CUDA do not install cuDNN. It needs to be installed seperately.

## What is NVCC:
NVCC stands for NVIDIA CUDA Compiler. NVCC makes binary of code that consists of GPU and CPU part.
